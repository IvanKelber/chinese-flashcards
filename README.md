A very basic flashcards application.

**Macro Todo**:

* Implement React UI (cards, tables, etc.)
* Alert the user of possible duplicates before they enter
* Allow the user to search for words in the DB
* Allow the user to include/exclude words in their flash cards
* Allow the user to specify the difficulty of the cards
* Allow the user to specify the number of cards shown
